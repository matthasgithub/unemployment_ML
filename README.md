This is an introductory ML project to get a handle on machine learning approaches to data science. In this project, unemployment rates are predicted 
using mortgage data. Three sources were used for data include the BLS, available at https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/la/ - the files 
required are la.measure, la.state_region_division, and la.data.3.AllStatesS. The second source is the NMDB, available at 
https://www.fhfa.gov/data/national-mortgage-database-aggregate-statistics - the data is new residential mortgage monthly statistics by state. 
Finally, Zillow home value estimate data can be found at https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ with Home Values by state.
